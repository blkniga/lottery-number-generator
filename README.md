# **Lottery Number Generator**

LNG is a command line python script that generates random lottery numbers.

The inspiration for this python script came about when I couldn't guess any lottery numbers for myself & I thought the given options in the most lottery services are somewhat bugged or rigged.

## _Requirements_

The are no prerequisites except for having Python installed in your OS. I recommend that you have or install Python using the Anaconda / Miniconda Distribution & set up a virtual environment to work on.

```python
conda activate
```

```python
conda create env "name of your virtual environment"
```

To deactivate your environment and return to the "base" environment:

```python
conda deactivate
```

For more information on how to install the Anaconda / Miniconda Distribution, please refer to this link below:

[Anaconda Distibution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

## _Execution_

To execute the script just run:

```python
python "the name of the file / script"
```

This assumes you're running the script on your terminal and are not using any code editor or IDE.

## **NB**

This repo will surely be updated in the next coming months when I get better with python and with web development. The plan is to have it available to everyone on the web. :smile: :v:
